# Waves-Tutorial
This is a set of worksheets I will be using to introduce waves to Modern Physics students over 4 weeks.  We start with a basic review, 
but end up talking about boundary conditions and Fourier series and transforms.

Very much a rough project and I'm not putting any thought into making the back-end user-friendly.
