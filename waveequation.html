<h1>4b. Wave Equation</h1>
<p><need>Is this an in-class exercise, or maybe an in-class lecture?</need></p>
In one dimension, classical waves satisfy the second-order differential equation
$${\partial^2\psi\over\partial t^2}=c^2{\partial^2\psi\over\partial x^2}$$
We solve this equation by separation of variables, looking for a separable solution \(\psi(x,t)=X(x)T(t)\).  Substituting this into the equation above gives us
$$
\let\om=\omega
\begin{align}
X(x)T''(t)&=c^2 X''(x)T(t)\\
\implies {T''(t)\over T(t)}&=c^2{X''(x)\over X(x)}=-\omega^2\\
T''(t)&=-\omega^2 T(t) \hbox{ and } X''(x)=-k^2X(x)\quad\hbox{(where $k\equiv\omega/c$)}\\
\end{align}$$
<ul class="checklist">
<li class="simple">Show that the equation \(T''(t)=-\omega^2 T(t)\) has solutions \(\sin\omega t\), \(\cos\om t\), \(e^{i\om t}\), and \(e^{-i\om t}\).
</ul>
These are second-order equations, so the general solution is a linear combination of two of the specific solutions.  We have a choice: we can either write the general solution in terms of trigonometric functions
$$T(t)=A\cos\om t+B\sin\om t \hbox{ and } X(x)=A\cos kx+B\sin kx$$
or in terms of complex exponentials
$$T(t)=A e^{i\om t}+Be^{-i\om t} \hbox{ and } X(x)=A e^{ikx}+Be^{-ikx}$$
(We could also do something like \(Ae^{i\om t}+B\cos\om t\), but that isn't commonly done.)

Hopefully you recognize \(\omega\) and \(k=\om/c\) as the angular frequency and wavenumber that we discussed earlier.  The solution of the wave equation for this particular wavenumber \(k\) is
$$\psi_k(x,t)=(A e^{ikx}+B e^{-ikx})(C e^{i\om t}+D e^{-i\om t})$$
We can expand out this polynomial to get
$$\psi_k(x,t)=A'_k e^{ik(x-ct)}+B'_k e^{-ik(x-ct)}+C'_k e^{ik(x+ct)}+D'_k e^{-ik(x+ct)}$$
where I've defined new constants and used the fact that \(\om=kc\).  Note that the first two terms have the form $f(x-ct)$: these are waves moving to the right with speed \(c\).  The last two terms have the form $f(x+vt)$, and so are waves moving to the left, also with speed \(c\).

<p>To get the most general solution, we add up \(\psi_k\) for all possible wavenumbers.
$$\psi(x,t)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty A'_k e^{ik(x-ct)}+\sum_{k=0}^\infty B'_k e^{-ik(x-ct)}+\sum_{k=0}^\infty C'_k e^{ik(x+ct)}+\sum_{k=0}^\infty D'_k e^{-ik(x+ct)}$$
(These sums will really be integrals, but you get the idea.)  Notice that the first two sums look exactly the same if we swap \(k\) with \(-k\) and define \(A'_{-k}=B'_k\), and similarly for the second two equations:
$$\psi(x,t)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty A'_k e^{ik(x-ct)}+\sum_{k=0}^{-\infty} A'_k e^{ik(x-ct)}+\sum_{k=0}^\infty C'_k e^{ik(x+ct)}+\sum_{k=0}^{-\infty} C'_k e^{ik(x+ct)}$$
We can combine the first two sums into a single sum from negative to positive infinity, and similarly for the last two sums:
$$\psi(x,t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty A'_k e^{ik(x-ct)}+\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty C'_k e^{ik(x+ct)}$$
The first sum is the sum over all waves travelling to the right, and the second, all waves travelling to the left.

From this derivation, we can see the advantage of using complex exponentials instead of trigonometric functions.
