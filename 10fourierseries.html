    <h2>Standing waves</h2>
    <need>In Section ___ we found the "standing waves" for a given 1D box, but those aren't the only possible waves that can exist inside the box.  Linear combinations of these are possible as well: you can have multiple frequencies in the box at the same time.  This is what happens on a guitar string.  When you pluck a guitar string, you create waves of all frequencies, only the resonant frequencies remain, and the resulting sound is the linear superposition of all of them. </need>
    <need>Look for some basic Fourier series introductions for inspiration</need>
<UL>
<LI>start with 7-LED digital displays maybe?
<LI>Taylor series
<LI>Change coefficients of signs, see what happens
