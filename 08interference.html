<need>Maybe I don't care about this chapter; it's not really headed where I want to go, and they should have seen it already. Save it for later.</need>
    <h2>Two-slit interference</h2>
    <p>In two or three dimensions, the superposition of waves can be more complicated, resulting in <i>interference patterns</i> of constructive or destructive interference.  We can see this in real life by dropping two rocks into a still pond, and seeing the checkerboard pattern that results.</p>
    <demo>Two sets of ripples: red and blue</demo>
    <p>No doubt you have seen Young's double-slit experiment in previous classes.  Monochromatic waves (i.e. waves with a single frequency) are emitted in phase from two point sources (such as laser light shining through two narrow slits), and projected onto a flat screen a certain distance away.

    Remember that the phase of a wave depends on distance and time according to
    $$\phi=kx-\omega t+\phi_0$$
    The phase increases as one moves in the direction of the wave's travel
    <p>The image shows the relatively simple case of two point wave sources which emit the same frequency of wave, and are in phase with one another.  This is a little tricky to setup in practice, but it can be done (cf Young's two-slit inter
