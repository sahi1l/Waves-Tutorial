SIMPLE:
Students visit each site with a link ending in ?code=4429tg4gh80 or whatever.
When the site is first visited, the server is queried. The server sends back
* A list of IDs of LIs to checkmark
* A list of IDs for inputs, along with their contents.
A red bar appears on top of the screen if the server can't be contacted.
When a checkmark is registered, send a message to the server with the code and the li name.
When an input is entered, send a message to the server with the code, the id, and the value

SERVER
SQL database with tables
PEOPLE: key (a number, 1-10), first name, last name, code (for ease of changing)
CHECKMARKS: key, chapter, id, checkedQ
INPUTS: key, chapter, id, value
AVAILABLE (a list of all possible ids): chapter, id, "c" or "i"

Commands:
* init(code,chapter) -> [id,id,...,(id,value),(id,value),...]
   > Get all checkmarks and inputs for a given chapter and code
* checkmarks(code,chapter,id,checked=TRUE) -> null
   > Add a checkmark for a given chapter, code, and id (or remove if checkedQ is FALSE)
* input(code,chapter,id,value) -> null
   > Update an input for a given chapter, code, id, and value
   > Alternatively, could return TRUE or FALSE if it is correct
* complete(code,chapter) -> boolean
   > is the page complete?
