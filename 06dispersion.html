<h1>5. Dispersion</h1><div id="chapter">6</div>
    
<p>For mechanical and electromagnetic waves, there is a simple relationship between the wavenumber and the angular frequency: \(k=c\omega\).  This means that waves with different frequencies also have different wavelengths.  This is called <i>dispersion</i>, and it is the reason a prism can split white light into its component colors (because the angle at which the light emerges depends on its wavelength, which in turn depends on its frequency or color.)</p>

<p>Notice that, for mechanical waves, the speed of the wave is independent of the frequency, because \(\omega\) is proportional to k.  There are other types of waves, however, where this is not true.  These are called <i>dispersive waves</i>, because waves of different frequencies travel at different speeds and so can spread out.</p>

<p>For example, in deep water waves, \(\omega=\sqrt{g|k|}\) where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity.  In matter waves, \(\omega={\hbar k^2\over 2m}\).  For these systems, the velocity of the wave becomes more difficult to define: in fact, there are <i>two</i> different types of velocity.</p>
